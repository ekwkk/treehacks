              Before you begin home-hunting, ask yourself what sort of residence best suits your needs and wants, how
              much home you can actually afford, how much financing you can get, and who will help you in your search.
              The actual homebuying process includes finding a place, securing financing, making an offer, obtaining a
              home inspection, and closing the deal. As a new homeowner, you must maintain the residence, but also to
              keep on saving moneyâ€”don't rely on selling a home to fund your retirement, no matter what the housing
              market does.
